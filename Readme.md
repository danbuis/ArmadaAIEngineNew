## Star Wars Armada AI

This project aims to create a java-based program to allow users to play Armada against a computer component.

To contribute to this repository please open a pull request addressing an outstanding issue.  I will work with you to ensure that your code addresses the problem sufficiently, is written cleanly, and is tested appropriately.

If you have a way to improve the program, or have a bug report, please open a new issue with all the pertinant details.

This project uses a custom library to harness the power of OpenGL to render via graphics card and connect the graphics rendering to an underlieing geometry handling library.  If you need a feature from that library, please open an issue in that repo and I will get it included in a reasonable time frame (danbuis/BBDGamesLibrary)
